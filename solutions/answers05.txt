## a.
output: '51'
5 becomes '5' and then is concatenated with '1'

## b.
output: 10
one is 5, and two is 5 also by default

## c.
output: 25
it doesn't matter what values are passed as arugments because
they are immediately overwritten when the function is run.
a and b will both always be 5.

## d. 
output: ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
if a function modifies the objects passed to it,
the changes are permenant

## e.
output: 72
when `do` runs, f is inp, so f(a) becomes inp(6) = 12
6 * 12 is 72.
